# Troubleshooting

## How to access the virtual machine of GitHub runner?

To access the virtual machine, the ID of the virtual machine must be known. The ID can be found in GitHub Actions logs. Once the ID is known, the virtual machine can be accessed by issuing a `fireactions microvm login <vmid>` command:

```bash
root@localhost:~# fireactions microvm login default-f093dd909cea44b35ef2d99e

VM ID: default-f093dd909cea44b35ef2d99e
IP Address: 192.168.128.28
Copy/paste to connect:

ssh -l root 192.168.128.28
```

The default password is `fireactions`. This can be changed by creating a custom image. Once logged in, the virtual machine can be managed as a regular Linux machine. Inside you will find `fireactions` service logs:

```bash
root@localhost:~# systemctl status fireactions
● fireactions.service - Fireactions
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/fireactions.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2024-09-27 14:54:48 UTC; 2 weeks 5 days ago
<...>
```

## containerd: creating snapshot: snapshotter not loaded: devmapper: invalid argument

If the following error is found in the logs:

```text
Nov 10 19:01:47 eu-lt-sng3-node3 fireactions[14729]: 2024-11-10 19:01:47 ERR pool.go:125 > Failed to scale pool error="containerd: creating snapshot: snapshotter not loaded: devmapper: invalid argument" pool=fireactions-2vcpu-2gb
```

This error is caused by the `devmapper` snapshotter not being loaded. To fix this, the `devmapper` snapshotter must be loaded. This can be done by adding the following line to the `containerd` configuration file:

```bash
tee /etc/containerd/config.toml <<EOF
[plugins]
  [plugins."io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.devmapper"]
    pool_name       = "containerd-thinpool"
    root_path       = "/var/lib/containerd/devmapper"
    base_image_size = "30GB"
    discard_blocks  = true
EOF

systemctl restart containerd
```

## containerd: creating snapshot: prepare: failed to create snapshot

If the following error is found in the logs:

```text
Nov 10 19:02:04 eu-lt-sng3-node3 fireactions[14729]: 2024-11-10 19:02:04 ERR pool.go:125 > Failed to scale pool error="containerd: creating snapshot: prepare: failed to create snapshot \"containerd-thinpool-snap-35\" (dev: 35) from \"containerd-thinpool-snap-23\" (dev: 23): no data available: unknown" pool=fireactions-2vcpu-2gb
```

The error message is not clear. This could happen when tampering with the installation. We've only been able to fix this by completely wiping Containerd namespaces and restarting the service. This is not a good solution, but it works.

To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
systemctl stop containerd

ctr namespaces ls

fireactions-2vcpu-4gb

ctr --namespace=fireactions-2vcpu-4gb snapshots --snapshotter=devmapper ls

## How to clean up orphaned GH Runners?

If there is a need to clean up GH Runners that have errored and didn't remove themselves, there is a one-line shell
command that can remove all runners that are currently offline.

Requirements:

- The tools `jq`, `xargs` and the GitHub CLI
- The GitHub CLI is authenticated with admin access to wherever the affected pool registers its runners:
    - **Organization scoped pools** (`runner.organization`): as an Organization Administrator of that organization.
    - **Repository scoped pools** (`runner.repository`): as a user with admin access to that repository. Organization
      Administrator access doesn't apply here, and isn't available at all for repositories owned by a personal account.

⚠️ **Warning**: This command will permanently delete runners. Ensure the account depends on fireactions and that
you have tested this in a non-production environment first. To preview which runners will be deleted without actually
deleting them please omit the `xargs` step in the shell commands.

To execute this command with bash, execute the following:

```bash
export GH_PAGER=
export ORG="<ORG>"
gh api --paginate /orgs/$ORG/actions/runners | jq '.runners[] | select(.status=="offline") | .id' | xargs -I {} gh api --method DELETE /orgs/$ORG/actions/runners/{}
```

To do the same with fish shell, execute the following:

```fish
set -x GH_PAGER
set -x ORG "<ORG>"
gh api --paginate /orgs/$ORG/actions/runners | jq '.runners[] | select(.status=="offline") | .id' | xargs -I {} gh api --method DELETE /orgs/$ORG/actions/runners/{}
```

Please replace `<ORG>` with the name of your GitHub Account or Organization.

For repository scoped pools (including pools of personal accounts), the runners live on the repository instead, so use
the repository endpoint. With bash:

```bash
export GH_PAGER=
export REPO="<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>"
gh api --paginate /repos/$REPO/actions/runners | jq '.runners[] | select(.status=="offline") | .id' | xargs -I {} gh api --method DELETE /repos/$REPO/actions/runners/{}
```

With fish shell:

```fish
set -x GH_PAGER
set -x REPO "<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>"
gh api --paginate /repos/$REPO/actions/runners | jq '.runners[] | select(.status=="offline") | .id' | xargs -I {} gh api --method DELETE /repos/$REPO/actions/runners/{}
```

Please replace `<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>` with the repository the pool registers its runners with.
